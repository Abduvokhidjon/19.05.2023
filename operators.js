Task 1: Using the logical && operator

You are coding an Superhero battle game, where each superhero has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.

Create a variable named superhero and set it your favorite superheroname.
Create a variable named score and set it to 5


Use console.log() that includes superhero, the string " has mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

The expected output in the console should be: "<superhero name> has mid-level skills: true".

var superhero
superhero = "Naruto"
var score 
score = 5
level = 0<score && score<10
console.log(superhero + " has mid-level skills: " + level )
